Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is a promising technique to enhance the security of Integrated Circuits by providing unique digital signatures, generated from physical properties of the device in which it is embedded. In this section, we introduce PUFs properties, their qualities and how estimate them. Furthermore, we present a detailed analysis on several PUFs implemented with FPGA technology.

A lot of effort has been made in researching on unique digital signature architectures for FPGA and ASIC devices, by exploiting Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs), since they can guarantee protection against IP violations. In this section, we introduce PUFs properties, their qualities and how estimate them. Furthermore, we present a detailed analysis on several PUFs implemented with FPGA technology.
