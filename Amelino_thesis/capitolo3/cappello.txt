Phyisically Unclonable Functions can be adopted to generate device-unique information used to address security related problems. In this Section we discuss PUFs mechanisms and protocols capable of providing device authentication, used to protect software and hardware IP cores by exploiting both obfuscation and cryptography. Additionally, we discuss their benefits, their vulnerabilities, and the effort needed to address them.
